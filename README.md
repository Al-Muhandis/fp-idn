# fp-idn

**fp-idn** is a lightweight Pascal library for encoding and decoding Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) using the [Punycode](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492) algorithm. Designed to be compatible with FreePascal and Lazarus projects, including console tools and server-side utilities.

## Features

* ‚úÖ Pure FreePascal implementation (no dependencies)
* üåç Supports full round-trip conversion between Unicode and Punycode
* üî§ Includes domain-level IDN handling with subdomain support
* üß™ Comes with comprehensive test coverage using FPCUnit

---

## Modules

* `fppunycode.pas`: Core Punycode encode/decode functions
* `fpidn.pas`: Domain-level IDN wrapper functions (`IDNToUnicode`, `UnicodeToIDN`)
* `test_idn_n_punycode.pas`: Unit tests for both modules

---

## Usage

### Convert UTF-8 to Punycode

```pascal
uses fppunycode;

var
  puny: string;
begin
  puny := UTF8ToPunycode('–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä');
end;
```

### Convert domain name using IDN module

```pascal
uses fpidn;

var
  encoded, decoded: string;
begin
  encoded := UnicodeToIDN('–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä.—Ä—Ñ');
  decoded := IDNToUnicode(encoded);
end;
```

---

## Build & Run Tests

### Windows

Run the batch script:

```cmd
build_tests.bat
```

### Linux/macOS

Run the shell script:

```bash
./build_tests.sh
```

You will see FPCUnit test output with full results in XML and console form.

## Requirements

* FreePascal 3.0+
* Optional: [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) for integration in GUI-based tools

Inspired by the need for lightweight, native Punycode support in FreePascal-based applications.
